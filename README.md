# Simple Blog

This repository contains a minimal blogging setup using a Python script and Bootstrap styling.

## Adding Posts

1. Create a Markdown file in the `posts/` directory. The first line should be the title starting with `#`.
2. Run `python3 generate.py` to regenerate the static site in the `docs/` folder.

The generated site can be served with GitHub Pages by selecting the `docs/` directory.
